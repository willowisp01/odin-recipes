        <p>It was a balmy summer evening in Venice, and the air was thick with the scent of espresso and the saltiness of the lagoon. I was at a small café, finishing an exquisite meal when the waiter brought over a dessert that he claimed would “steal my heart.” Tiramisu, he called it—layers of mascarpone, ladyfingers soaked in coffee, and a light dusting of cocoa. With the first bite, I was hooked, the perfect balance of creamy, bitter, and sweet leaving me speechless.</p>
        <p>Since that evening, tiramisu has become more than just a dessert to me; it’s a celebration of indulgence and simplicity. When I make it at home, I whisk the mascarpone with care, dip the ladyfingers into espresso, and think back to that café on the water’s edge. It’s amazing how a humble dessert can transport you to another time, another place, and evoke the warmth of a Venetian summer.</p>

    <h2>Recipe</h2>

    <div>
        <ol>
            <li>Brew espresso or strong coffee and let it cool. Stir in Marsala wine or rum (if using) and set aside.</li>
            <li>In a heatproof bowl, whisk the egg yolks and sugar together until pale and creamy.</li>
            <li>Place the bowl over a pot of simmering water (double boiler) and whisk continuously until the mixture thickens slightly. Remove from heat and let cool.</li>
            <li>Whisk the mascarpone into the egg yolk mixture until smooth.</li>
            <li>In a separate bowl, whip the heavy cream to soft peaks and gently fold it into the mascarpone mixture.</li>
            <li>Quickly dip each ladyfinger into the coffee mixture (don’t soak, as they will become soggy) and arrange them in a single layer in a 9x9-inch dish.</li>
            <li>Spread half of the mascarpone cream over the ladyfingers.</li>
            <li>Repeat with another layer of dipped ladyfingers and top with the remaining mascarpone cream.</li>
            <li>Cover the dish with plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 4 hours, preferably overnight, to allow the flavors to meld.</li>
            <li>Before serving, dust the top generously with cocoa powder. Optionally, sprinkle grated dark chocolate for extra indulgence.</li>
        </ol>
