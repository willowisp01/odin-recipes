    <div>
        <p>There’s something magical about the first snowfall of winter. It was a brisk December evening when my grandmother
            called me into her kitchen, her apron dusted with flour and her hands busy layering sheets of pasta. “Tonight,”
            she said, “we warm our hearts with lasagna.” As the snowflakes fell silently outside, I watched her meticulous
            process: the ricotta spread like a blanket over noodles, the rich meat sauce that simmered for hours, and the
            generous sprinkling of mozzarella and Parmesan. To me, that wasn’t just dinner—it was a ceremony of love.</p>
        <p>Years later, I find myself recreating her lasagna on chilly evenings, channeling her warmth into every layer. The
            smell of tomatoes, garlic, and melted cheese fills my home, and for a moment, I am back in her cozy kitchen,
            snow tapping gently at the windows. It’s incredible how food can hold memories, like pressed flowers in the
            pages of a book.</p>

    <h2>Recipe</h2>
    
    <div>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat.</li>
            <li>Add the ground beef and Italian sausage (if using) and cook until browned, breaking it apart with a spoon.</li>
            <li>Stir in the onion and garlic, cooking until softened (about 5 minutes).</li>
            <li>Add the crushed tomatoes, tomato paste, dried basil, oregano, salt, and sugar (if using). Simmer for 20-30 minutes, stirring occasionally.</li>
            <li>In a mixing bowl, combine ricotta cheese, egg, Parmesan cheese, and parsley. Mix until smooth and set aside.</li>
            <li>If using regular lasagna noodles, cook them in boiling salted water according to the package instructions. Drain and lay them flat on parchment paper to prevent sticking. Skip this step for no-boil noodles.</li>
            <li>Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C).</li>
            <li>In a 9x13-inch baking dish, spread a thin layer of meat sauce on the bottom.</li>
            <li>Layer 3-4 lasagna noodles on top, then spread a layer of the cheese mixture, followed by meat sauce. Sprinkle with shredded mozzarella.</li>
            <li>Repeat the layers (noodles, cheese, sauce, mozzarella) until you run out of ingredients, finishing with a generous layer of mozzarella and Parmesan on top.</li>
            <li>Cover the dish with aluminum foil (to prevent the cheese from burning) and bake for 25 minutes.</li>
            <li>Remove the foil and bake for an additional 15-20 minutes until the cheese is bubbly and golden brown.</li>
            <li>Let the lasagna rest for 10-15 minutes before slicing.</li>
        </ol>
